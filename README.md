# Beginner tutorials
## Overview
This code is a simple walker node which uses the turtlebot3 model and autonomously navigates it through a world with obstacles. The walker node publishes messages to the /cmd_vel topic of the turtlebot3 which runs the robot in the simulation world. For this, the robot uses sensor_msgs/LaserScan data, more specifically, from the "ranges" array.

## Dependencies

   - ROS Noetic
   - Modern C++ Programming Language
   - std_Msgs Package
   - sensor_msgs Package
   - geometry_msgs Package
   - Roscpp Package
   - Catkin_Make build system

## Build

### Create Catkin Workspace
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make clean && catkin_make
```
### Copy the repository in src folder of catkin workspace
```
cd src 
git clone https://github.com/gauraut/walker.git
cd ..
catkin_make clean && catkin_make
source ./devel/setup.bash
```
## Downloading the turtlebot3 packge in you catkin workspace
In a new terminal window,
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```
## Running the simulation

### Make sure Roscore is running
```
roscore
```
### Open the turtlebot3 in a simulation world with obstacles
In a new terminal window,
```
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch  # Opens turtlebot in Gazebo environment
```
### To run the walker node's launch file
```
roslaunch walker walker_launch.launch # By default the rosbag recording is Off
```
The robot will autuonomously run and cover the whole world while avoiding obstacles.

## Bag files
### Recording with the launch file
```
roslaunch walker walker_launch.launch record_walker:=true  # By defalt, is set to false
```
The rosbag will be saved in the package's results folder with th name as "all_topics.bag"
### Disabling bag file recording
By default, the rosbag recording is disabled. Just run the launch file.
### Inspecting the bag file
```
rosbag info your_rosbag_file.bag
```
Example output:
```

```
### Playing the recorded rosbag
Make sure all processes related to ROS are killed.
Open a new terminal and enter,
```
roscore
```
On a separate terminal
```
rosbag play file_name.bag
```
